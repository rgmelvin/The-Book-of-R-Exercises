# The-Book-of-R-Exercises
Exercises from 'The Book of R' by Tilman M. Davies.

Now that I have some Python under my belt and understand the logic fairly well, it is time to do self guided study of R.

I purchased Tilman M. Davies book titled 'The Book of R' and I am reading and working my way through it.

In this repository, I am archiving R markdown documents of my answers to the Exercises associated with each chapter and section of the book.
